# 🤖 AI Agents in LangGraph
This project demonstrates how to build and orchestrate AI agents using LangGraph, a framework designed for building stateful, multi-step LLM applications. LangGraph enables graph-based control flows for AI agents and allows dynamic decision-making powered by LLMs such as GPT-4.

## 🚀 What This Project Covers
🌐 LangGraph setup for multi-agent architecture

🤝 Agent collaboration using graph-based workflows

🧠 Integration with OpenAI or other LLM providers

🔧 Tools integration (calculator, web search, etc.)

🔄 Cycles, branches, and conditional logic using graph edges

📈 Tracking and managing conversational state

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

Python 3.10+

LangGraph

LangChain

OpenAI API (for LLM agents)

Any tool plugins (e.g. calculator, search, vector store)

## ⚙️ Getting Started

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/abhinav744/AI-Agents-in-LangGraph.git

cd AI-Agents-in-LangGraph

### 2️⃣ Create a Virtual Environment

python -m venv venv

source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

### 3️⃣ Install Dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

### 4️⃣ Set Up Environment Variables
Create a .env file or configure config.py with your OpenAI key:

OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key

### 5️⃣ Run the Application

python main.py

You’ll be able to interact with the LangGraph-powered agents directly in the console or API interface (if implemented).

## 📊 How LangGraph Works

Each node in the graph is an agent or processing unit.

Edges define conditional paths depending on output.

Cycles allow agents to repeat reasoning steps until a condition is met (e.g., “Final Answer”).

## 🧠 Example Use Case

Agent 1: Takes a user query

Agent 2: Determines if a tool is needed (e.g., calculator or search)

Tool: Executes the action

Agent 3: Summarizes the result

Graph ends when an "answer" node is reached

## 🧩 Potential Extensions

🌐 Web-based frontend using Streamlit or Gradio

💾 Memory via LangChain’s conversation buffer or Redis

📊 Logging and trace visualization (via LangSmith or custom UI)

🔐 Multi-agent authentication or access control
